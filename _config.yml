 Greetings! My name is JD, and I find joy in bringing digital creations to life. 
 
 My passion for web development was ignited in 2016 with building and maintaining WordPress websites for various companies. With a professional background in IT and network administration, I have gained valuable experience from a medium-sized internet service provider. 
 
 Currently, I am pursuing a part-time degree in Business Management while continuously refining my developer skills. I am delighted to present my portfolio, which showcases my expertise and enthusiasm for creating impactful web-based solutions.

 Here are a few technologies that I've worked with recently:
 <mark>Node.js</mark> <mark>React</mark> <mark>JavaScript (ES6+)</mark> <mark>WordPress</mark>

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
